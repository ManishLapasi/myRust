# What I've learned

- `cargo` is a rust package manager of sorts
- similar to npm
- `cargo new $projectname`
- `cargo build` - builds project, doesn't run
    - default is dev, so to run default exe, run `./target/dev/$filename`
- `cargo run` - build and run
- `cargo check` - check for bugs
- `toml` file - package and dependency management (like `package.json` files in js)
