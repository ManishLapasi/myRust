# What I've learned

- `let` creates a variable. Using it again creates a shadow variable
- `mut` variables can be edited by just assigning `x=6`. If we want a shadow `x`, we would do `let x=6`
- We can change type of shadow variables, but cannot change type of mut
- We cannot edit const in any way once initialised
- `char` in single quotes, `string` in double quotes
